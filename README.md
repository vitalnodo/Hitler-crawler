# Hitler-crawler

Yet another multithreaded crawler that allows to check six degrees of wikipedia
and find how "Tomato" and "Adolf_Hitler" is connected. It took me a few hours 
to understand the nuances of Python and two hours to write.
To start a program execute

```bash
python main.py
```


and enter start and end or press enter twice if one is happy
with defaults (Tomato and Adolf_Hitler).
One can also specify max_depths and max_workers in code.
